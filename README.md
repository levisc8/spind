`spind` is a package for dealing with spatially autocorrelated data in instances of 2-D gridded data sets. We provide you with a suite of functions that can compute spatial models based on Generalized Estimating Equations (GEEs) and Wavelet-Revised Models (WRMs) based on the work of Gudrun Carl, Ingolf Kuehn, and others. We also provide an array of options to conduct model selection procedures and assess goodness of fit for your model using spatially corrected statistics.
