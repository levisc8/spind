## Submission

This is a submission of Spind_2.0.1. Many apologies for the rapid
update. I made a mistake in the inst/ file and the wrong version
of the vignette was included initially. Additionally, I forgot 
to include the CITATION file. I know you are all very busy
and I am very sorry for rapidly resubmitting. I will strive to 
avoid this in the future. 

All passed with no ERRORS OR WARNINGS.

Tested on win-builder with the following results: 

R-oldrelease had the following NOTE:
* checking dependencies in R code ... NOTE
Namespace in Imports field not imported from: 'sp'
  All declared Imports should be used. 

'sp' is listed in IMPORTS because it is listed
DEPENDS for 'splancs', which our package does use.
This NOTE was also present in the spind_2.0.0 submission.

ALL builds had the following NOTE: 
* checking CRAN incoming feasibility ... NOTE
Maintainer: 'Sam Levin <levisc8@gmail.com>'
New submission

This NOTE was also present in spind_2.0.0 submission


Also tested on:
* ubuntu 12.04 (on travis-ci), R 3.3.3
* macOS X 10.11.6

*Built cleanly on these two platforms with no 
ERRORS, WARNINGS, or NOTES
