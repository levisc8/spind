\title{Wavelet variance analysis}
\usage{
wavevar(f, x, y, wavelet = "haar", wtrafo = "dwt")
}
\arguments{
\item{f}{A vector}

\item{x}{Corresponding x-coordinates which have to be integer}

\item{y}{Corresponding y-coordinates which have to be integer}

\item{wavelet}{Name of wavelet family. \code{haar}, \code{d4}, and \code{la8}.
are possible. \code{haar} is the default.}

\item{wtrafo}{Type of wavelet transform. Either \code{dwt} or \code{modwt}.
\code{dwt} is the default.}
}
\value{
Wavelet variance for \code{f}.
}
\description{
Calculates the variance of parameters in a wavelet
multiresolution analysis. This is a 2D analysis taking the grid
structure of datasets into account and provides scale-specific
results for data sampled on a contiguous geographical area. The
dataset is assumed to be regular gridded and the grid cells are
assumed to be square.
